Among other things, it covers the game theory behind the system's novel liquidation mechanism, quantifies the risk of Bitcoin as a collateral, and it formally analyses the veto-based governance system. The Frankencoin system can be seen as a Continuous Capital Corporation, a concept introduced in chapter three denoting a company that issues and redeems shares autonomously according to fixed rules that are optimal under a wide range of theoretical assumptions.",
