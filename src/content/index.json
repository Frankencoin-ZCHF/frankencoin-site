			{
				"title": "Collateralized debt position",
				"description": "Frankencoin operates as a decentralized collateralized debt position system. Users deposit crypto assets as collateral to mint digital Swiss francs (ZCHF).

			{
				"title": "Why 1 ZCHF equals 1 CHF",
				"description": "Each ZCHF token is over-collateralized, backed by assets worth more than 1 Swiss franc. This structural over-collateralization ensures price stability and provides a robust backing mechanism that maintains the 1:1 peg to the Swiss franc.",
				"link": "https://docs.frankencoin.com/reserve"
			},
			{
				"title": "Market-driven price stability",
				"description": "The peg is maintained through arbitrage opportunities: When ZCHF trades below parity, market participants profit by purchasing discounted tokens and redeeming the underlying collateral. When ZCHF trades above parity, participants profit by minting new tokens and selling at a premium. These arbitrage mechanisms create natural market forces that maintain equilibrium at 1 CHF.",

Among other things, it covers the game theory behind the system's novel liquidation mechanism, quantifies the risk of Bitcoin as a collateral, and it formally analyses the veto-based governance system. The Frankencoin system can be seen as a Continuous Capital Corporation, a concept introduced in chapter three denoting a company that issues and redeems shares autonomously according to fixed rules that are optimal under a wide range of theoretical assumptions.",
